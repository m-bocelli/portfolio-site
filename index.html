                                <p>A 3D implementation of the <b>Boids Algorithm</b>, performed by crows in Unity.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Invented by computer graphics expert <b>Craig Reynolds</b>, the boids algorithm simulates the coordinated motion of animals 
                                    such as a flock of birds or a school of fish. I came across the algorithm accidentally while researching the animation techniques 
                                    behind a game called <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> on an internet forum. After discovering it, I was motivated to implement it 
                                    myself in a 3D game engine environment so I could utilize it for future projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also enjoyed this project as I was able to use programming concepts that I learned outside of class, such as delegates and lamda
                                    expressions.

                                    My first webpage, besides a <i>Spongebob</i> wiki I made for a class in 9th grade. What I enjoy most about this project is all
                                    the extra knowledge which comes as a byproduct while researching HTML and CSS. Although this is true for other projects,
                                    I have not taken a web development course, so while teaching myself the basics I come across interesting features I might
                                    not have otherwise (albeit getting sidetracked at times).

                                <p>A recreation of the 1979 Atari classic <i>Asteroids</i>, made with the Designer library.</p>
                                <p>
                                    This was my first final in my first computer science class in college. We had the option to choose between recreating
                                    <i>Snake</i> and <i>Asteroids</i> as our final project, both of which needed to be created from scratch. I was told that 
                                    <i>Asteroids</i> would be the tougher choice, so of course I chose it. The library used (Designer) was created by one of
                                    our faculty's professors and was very enjoyable to work with when putting this project together.
